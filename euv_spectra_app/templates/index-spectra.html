        The full PEGASUS model grid is available for download. <br><br>

        Each subgrid contains 72 models with different upper atmospheric structures. These models have EUV-NUV flux densities that span three orders of magnitude. <br><br>

        The PHOENIX spectra (EUV â€“ IR; 100 Angstroms to 100 microns) are saved in FITS file format. The wavelengths (given in Angstroms) are in vacuum and the wavelength grid has a resolution of &lt;0.1 Angstroms. Please note that the wavelength grid is not uniformly spaced. The flux densities (given in ergs/cm<sup>2</sup>/s/Angstrom) are that at the stellar surface and are scalable to a distance D via (R_star/D)<sup>2</sup>. <br><br>
